# Catholic Diocese App

## About

The Catholic Diocese App for Android was created in 2012 by Jeff Geerling of Midwestern Mac, LLC, originally for the Jesuit Conference in the US. The app was intended to help not only the Jesuits, but also any other diocese or organization that wanted to build an App for Android devices.

## License

The Catholic Diocese App is licensed under an MIT/Expat license. See LICENSE.txt for more information.

## Current Status

The app is ready for adaptation to any dioceses' needs, though there are still a few features that we're working on to make it easier to adapt, and more fully-featured. Stay tuned to Open Source Catholic and to the Wiki pages of this project on GitHub for more info and updates.
