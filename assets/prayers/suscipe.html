    <h1>Suscipe</h1>
    <h2>St. Ignatius of Loyola</h2>
    <p>Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty,<br />
    my memory, my understanding,<br />
    and my entire will,<br />
    All I have and call my own.</p>
    <p>You have given all to me.<br />
    To you, Lord, I return it.</p>
    <p>Everything is yours; do with it what you will.<br />
    Give me only your love and your grace,<br />
    that is enough for me.</p>
