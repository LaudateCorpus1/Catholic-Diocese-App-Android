    <h1>Prayer for Generosity</h1>
    <h2>St. Ignatius of Loyola</h2>
    <p>Lord, teach me to be generous.<br />
    Teach me to serve you as you deserve;<br />
    to give and not to count the cost,<br />
    to fight and not to heed the wounds,<br />
    to toil and not to seek for rest,<br />
    to labor and not to ask for reward,<br />
    save that of knowing that I do your will.</p>
