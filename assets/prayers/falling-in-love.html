    <h1>Falling in Love</h1>
    <h2>by Jesuit Father Pedro Arrupe</h2>
    <p>Nothing is more practical than<br />
    finding God, that is, than<br />
    Falling in love<br />
    In a quite absolute, final way.<br />
    What you are in love with,<br />
    What seizes your imagination,<br />
    Will affect everything.<br />
    It will decide<br />
    What will get you out of bed<br />
    In the morning,<br />
    What you do with your evenings,<br />
    How you spend your weekends,<br />
    What you read, who you know,<br />
    What breaks your heart,<br />
    And what amazes you with<br />
    Joy and Gratitude.<br />
    Fall in love, stay in love,<br />
    And it will decide everything.<br /></p>
